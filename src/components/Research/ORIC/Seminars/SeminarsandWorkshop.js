                                    These Workshops allow students to study and gain insight into a wide range of topics while also motivating 
                                    them to pursue new interests. They are often designed to encourage a facilitator to give particular attention 
                                    to each attendee. A workshop requires participants to take a hands-on approach to immediately use the skills 
                                    they are learning while also being tested so that they comprehend the correct outcomes.
